By using this app, you consent for your data to be used in a research study conducted by the Brown University Human-Computer Interaction Lab.

We are exploring how social mood-tracking through emoji-only communication impacts feelings of social support and loneliness. We seek to better identify and understand anonymous mood-tracking and online social networks, and their effects on mental health, community, self-disclosure, and social support.


The risks of participating in this project are no greater than those experienced in everyday life. There are no costs or compensation for participating. You may not directly benefit from participating. You may find consistent mood-tracking helpful for self-reflection, however we cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from app use.

All app users are anonymized. Your personal information is not linked to your account, and you will post under a randomized username. All collected data will be kept on private, encrypted machines. Other users of the app may see the content of your posts under your randomized username. Your anonymized data may be used or shared for future research.

Your participation in this project is voluntary. You may decide not to participate, choose not to answer any question, or stop participating at any time without any penalty. You can stop participating in this study at any time by ceasing use of the app. Your decision whether or not to participate will have no effect on your relationship with Brown University. 

If you have any questions about your participation in this study, you can contact the Lead Researcher, Talie Massachi, at talie_massachi@brown.edu. You can also contact her advisor Jeff Huang at jeff_huang@brown.edu.
